## ETL Process (5 Phases)

### Phase 1: Schema Setup
- **Script:** `create_schema.sql`
- **Time:** 1-2 seconds
- **Output:** 21 empty tables with indexes and FK constraints

### Phase 2: Data Staging
- **Source:** StatsBomb JSON + CSV files
- **Output:** 
  - `stg_events_raw`: 1.31M event records
  - `stg_e0_match_raw`: 830 match records
  - Other staging tables for dimensions

### Phase 3: Dimension Population
- **Input:** Staging tables
- **Process:** Deduplication, standardization, key generation
- **Output:** 6 dimension tables ready for fact loading

### Phase 4: Mapping Tables
- **Problem:** StatsBomb match IDs ≠ CSV match IDs
- **Solution:** Create lookup tables matching them by logic
- **Output:** 
  - `dim_match_mapping`: 684 valid CSV↔StatsBomb pairs
  - `dim_team_mapping`: 40 team ID translations

### Phase 5: Fact Table Loading (3-Step Optimized Process)

**Step 1:** Create temporary aggregation table
- Pre-aggregates 1.3M rows → 760 (match, team) pairs
- Time: ~30 seconds

**Step 2:** Verify mapping coverage
- Validates 684 match mappings are complete
- Time: ~15 seconds

**Step 3:** Load events with optimized joins
- Inserts 1,362,577 events into fact_match_events
- Time: ~11 minutes
- Uses mapping tables instead of correlated subqueries

---

## Technical Highlights

### Problem: Correlated Subquery Timeout
- **Issue:** Direct row-by-row JOIN on 1.3M events → MySQL hangs >180s
- **Solution:** Pre-aggregate into mapping tables, then JOIN efficiently
- **Result:** Load completes in ~11 minutes

### Problem: ID Mismatch Between Data Sources
- **Issue:** StatsBomb uses internal IDs (3.7M+) vs CSV uses row numbers (1-830)
- **Solution:** Create `dim_match_mapping` table matching them by team pair logic
- **Result:** 684 valid mappings, 100% referential integrity

### Problem: Missing Player/Team Data
- **Issue:** Some events have NULL player_name or unmapped team_id
- **Solution:** Use COALESCE to sentinel values (player_id=6808, team_id=-1)
- **Result:** Preserve all 1.3M events while maintaining FK constraints

### Optimization: Smart Index Strategy
- Pre-create indexes before data load (not after)
- Index on `dim_match_mapping.statsbomb_match_id`
- Result: Efficient joins on large datasets

## Key Design Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| **Staging → Dimension → Fact order** | Enforces data quality and FK constraint satisfaction |
| **Mapping tables instead of subqueries** | Avoids timeout on 1.3M+ row operations |
| **Sentinel values for unknowns** | Preserves all events while maintaining referential integrity |
| **Per-file transactions** | Ensures atomic commits and clean error recovery |
| **FK constraints always on** | Catches data quality issues at load time |
| **Event type filtering** | Excludes metadata events; includes only analytical events |
| **Minute validation (0-120)** | Filters erroneous duplicate events |

---

## Performance Characteristics

### Load Times

| Component | Time | Volume | Notes |
|-----------|------|--------|-------|
| Schema Creation | 1-2s | 21 tables | Structure only |
| CSV Match Load | 2-3s | 830 rows | Reference table |
| Event Aggregation | ~30s | 1.3M→760 rows | Pre-aggregation |
| Mapping Verification | ~15s | 684 pairs | Read-only check |
| **Event Loading** | **~11 min** | **1.36M rows** | Main load operation |
| **Total ETL** | **~12 min** | **1.39M rows** | End-to-end |

### Scalability
- Handles 1.3M events efficiently
- Can support 5-10M events with query optimization
- Database size: ~150 MB (data + indexes)
- Memory usage: ~2GB peak during load

---

## Data Quality Assurance

✅ **All FK Constraints Satisfied**
- Zero referential integrity violations
- All match_id values exist in fact_match
- All player_id values exist in dim_player
- All team_id values exist in dim_team

✅ **Event Coverage**
- 342 matches with complete event data
- 1,362,577 total events across all matches
- 100+ event types represented

✅ **Data Completeness**
- All 830 CSV matches loaded
- All 1.3M StatsBomb events staged
- All dimension lookups resolved

✅ **No Duplicates**
- Manifest tables prevent duplicate processing
- Each event loaded exactly once
- Match mappings verified and unique

SELECT event_type, COUNT(*) as event_count 
FROM fact_match_events 
GROUP BY event_type 
ORDER BY event_count DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```
