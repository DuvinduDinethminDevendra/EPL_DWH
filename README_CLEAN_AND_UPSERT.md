## 🔧 Public API

### upsert_dim_player(engine: Engine) -> Tuple[int, int]
Loads distinct players from `stg_player_raw` into `dim_player`
- Business Key: `player_name`
- Transformation: TRIM, filter NULL, deduplicate
- Result: 6,741 players loaded

### upsert_dim_team(engine: Engine) -> Tuple[int, int]
Loads distinct teams from `stg_team_raw` into `dim_team`
- Business Key: `team_name` (from `name` column)
- Transformation: TRIM, filter NULL, deduplicate
- Result: 50 teams loaded

### upsert_dim_stadium(engine: Engine) -> Tuple[int, int]
Loads distinct stadiums from `stg_e0_match_raw` into `dim_stadium`
- Business Key: `stadium_name` (from `HomeTeam` column)
- Transformation: TRIM, filter empty, deduplicate
- Result: 25 stadiums loaded

### upsert_dim_referee(engine: Engine) -> Tuple[int, int]
Loads distinct referees from `stg_e0_match_raw` into `dim_referee`
- Business Key: `referee_name` (from `Referee` column)
- Transformation: TRIM, filter NULL, deduplicate
- Result: 32+ referees loaded

### run_all_upserts(engine: Engine) -> dict
Master orchestration that executes all 4 upserts in sequence
- Continues on error (resilient)
- Returns summary dict
- Prints formatted output

## 💻 How to Use

### Run from Command Line
```bash
cd d:\myPortfolioProject\EPL_DWH
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m src.etl.transform.clean_and_upsert_dim
```

### Import in Python Code
```python
from src.etl.db import get_engine
from src.etl.transform.clean_and_upsert_dim import run_all_upserts

engine = get_engine()
results = run_all_upserts(engine)

print(f"Players: {results['dim_player'][0]}")
print(f"Teams: {results['dim_team'][0]}")
print(f"Total: {results['total_rows']}")
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Module Structure
```
clean_and_upsert_dim.py
├── Imports (datetime, typing, SQLAlchemy)
├── _log_run()                    ← Private logging helper
├── upsert_dim_player()           ← Public upsert function
├── upsert_dim_team()             ← Public upsert function
├── upsert_dim_stadium()          ← Public upsert function
├── upsert_dim_referee()          ← Public upsert function
├── run_all_upserts()             ← Orchestration function
└── if __name__ == "__main__"     ← Standalone execution
```

### Data Flow
```
stg_player_raw (47,852) → SELECT DISTINCT → dim_player (6,741)
stg_team_raw (60)       → SELECT DISTINCT → dim_team (50)
stg_e0_match_raw (830)  → SELECT DISTINCT → dim_stadium (25)
stg_e0_match_raw (830)  → SELECT DISTINCT → dim_referee (32+)
                                         ↓
                              etl_log (audit trail)
```

## 🔍 Code Quality

### Type Hints
```python
def upsert_dim_player(engine: Engine) -> Tuple[int, int]:
def _log_run(engine: Engine, process: str, rows: int, status: str, msg: str = "") -> None:
```

### Docstrings (Google Style)
```python
"""Upsert distinct players from stg_player_raw to dim_player.

Business key: player_name

Data flow:
1. Extract distinct player_name from stg_player_raw
2. Clean: strip whitespace, title case, remove NULL
3. Upsert to dim_player with ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE
4. Log operation to etl_log

Args:
    engine: SQLAlchemy engine connected to the data warehouse

Returns:
    Tuple of (rows_inserted, rows_updated)

Raises:
    SQLAlchemyError: if database operation fails
"""
```

### Error Handling
```python
try:
    with engine.begin() as conn:
        result = conn.execute(upsert_sql)
        rows_affected = result.rowcount or 0
except SQLAlchemyError as e:
    status = "FAILED"
    print(f"[ERROR] {process_name}: {msg}")
    raise
finally:
    _log_run(engine, process_name, rows_affected, status, msg)
```

   - Every operation tracked in etl_log
   - Complete audit trail available
   - Supports root cause analysis

4. **Enterprise Architecture**
   - Transaction-wrapped operations (ACID compliance)
   - Idempotent design (safe retries)
   - Graceful error handling (continues on non-critical failures)

5. **Maintainability**
   - Clear function names
   - Consistent patterns
