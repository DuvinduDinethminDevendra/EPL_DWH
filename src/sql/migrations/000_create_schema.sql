-- 000_create_schema.sql
-- Baseline canonical schema (same as canonical create_schema.sql)

-- This file is a migration baseline. It should create all required tables and baseline objects.

-- For brevity this file intentionally references the canonical `create_schema.sql` maintained in the repo root
-- When using a migration tool (Alembic, flyway) you'd either include this file as the baseline or generate it from the live DB.

-- NOTE: The canonical `create_schema.sql` is already present at src/sql/create_schema.sql and used during container init.
-- This baseline migration file is a placeholder to be used with an external migration runner.
