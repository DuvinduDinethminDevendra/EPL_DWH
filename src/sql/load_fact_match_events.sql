--  Load Fact Match Events Table (from StatsBomb Open Data)
-- ================================================================================================
--  Description: Transforms StatsBomb events from stg_events_raw into fact_match_events
--  Source:      stg_events_raw (populated from StatsBomb JSON files)
--  Target:      fact_match_events
--  Idempotency: Achieved via DELETE + INSERT pattern
--  Logic:       Map StatsBomb match_id to fact_match.match_id, player names to IDs, team names to IDs

-- Step 1: Perform the transformation from staging to fact table.
