## Sentinel Strategy Documented

### For New Users
> **The Sentinel Question:** "Why do we need both -1 and 6808?"
>
> **Answer:**
> - **-1** = Unknown/generic key used across ALL dimensions
> - **6808** = Unknown PLAYER (specific to dim_player)
> - **Why?** Player IDs naturally range 1-6847, so 6808 (way above) = synthetic
> - **Benefit** = Easy to filter: `WHERE player_id NOT IN (-1, 6808)`

### In README
```markdown
| Sentinel ID | Usage | Purpose |
|------------|-------|---------|
| **-1** | dim_stadium, dim_team, dim_referee, dim_season, dim_date | Primary "Unknown" key |
| **6808** | dim_player only | Secondary unknown player |
```
